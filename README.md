<hr/>

This is a starter Rust and React project.

> **WARNING!** This project still in development.
> Everything is experimental, breaking changes can happen and the long-term purpose of this project is not yet clear, use at your own risk!

## üèÅ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The following are required to run the application in development or in production environment:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) v1.70 or greater.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v18.16.0 or greater.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) PostgreSQL server v14 or greater.
- [sqlx](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx) for interacting with the database.
- [sqlx-cli](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx-cli) a command line tool for sqlx.
- [cargo-px](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-px), a cargo sub-command designed to augment cargo's capabilities.
- [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch), a tool for watching the project files and recompiling when they change.
- [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/), task runner and build tool to be simpler and easier to use.
- [toml-cli](https://github.com/gnprice/toml-cli), a simple CLI for editing and querying TOML files.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install), v2.10 or greater, only required when building container image.

### Create New Project

Install [`cargo-generate`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate) sub-command then execute:

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/riipandi/carats -b main -n myapp-name
```

> Don't forget to change `myapp-name` with your real application name.

### Generate Secret Key

Before you continue, you need to create `.env` file (you can duplicate `.env.example`) and
fill the `application secret key` with some random string. To generate a secret key, use
the following command:

```sh
cargo run --quiet --locked -- generate-secret
```

### Up and Running

1. Prepare environment: `task start-compose`
2. Install dependencies: `task deps`
3. Run database migration: `task migrate`
4. Start development: `task dev`

Application will run at `http://localhost:9090`

### Essential Commands

```sh
task dev             # start development
task build           # build binary file
task run             # run release mode
task docker-build    # build docker image
task docker-run      # run the docker image
task docker-push     # publish the docker image
```

> List all available tasks: `task --list-all`

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Development

To run the application in development mode, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Change the `DATABASE_URL` variables value.
4. Run `sqlx database create` to create the database from the specified `DATABASE_URL`
5. Run `sqlx migrate run` to run the migrations
6. use `sqlx migrate add -r <migration_name>` to add a new migration

**Note**: Use `sqlx database drop` to revert the change

### Publish Docker Image

```sh
echo $GH_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io --username CHANGEME --password-stdin
```

### Running Docker Image

```sh
docker run --rm -it --name carats --env-file .env.docker -p 9090:9090 ghcr.io/riipandi/carats:edge
```

### Simple Load Testing

Using [`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) to perform a simple load testing.

```sh
hey -m GET -n 200 -z 10s http://127.0.0.1:9090/api
```
